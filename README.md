             OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
PROJECT : INTERNET OF THINGS ON HEALTH MONITORING WEARABLE DEVICE

Objective :
The primary objective of a health monitoring wearable device is to continuously monitor various health parameters of the user, providing real-time data and insights to improve health outcomes and support preventive care.

Key Activities:
Identify target demographics and specific health metrics to monitor.
Assess market needs, existing solutions, and competitive landscape.
Requirement Analysis and Specification
Define functional and non-functional requirements.
List out the health parameters to be monitored (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, ECG, etc.).
Technology Selection and Design
Choose sensors and components for accurate and reliable data collection.
Select connectivity options (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular).
Decide on data storage and processing solutions (on-device, cloud-based).
Hardware Development
Design and prototype the device hardware.
Integrate sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules.
Ensure ergonomic and aesthetic design for user comfort.
Software Development
Develop firmware for data collection, processing, and communication.
